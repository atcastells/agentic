## Patterns

- [2025-04-14 14:15:26] - Memory Bank initialized. No patterns defined yet.
### [2025-04-14 14:56:19] - Layered (N-tier) Architecture
Role: Separates Agentic backend into logical layers (e.g., API, business logic, data access) for modularity and maintainability.
Rationale: Enables clear responsibility boundaries, easier testing, and independent evolution of layers.

### [2025-04-14 14:56:19] - Plugin/Provider Architecture
Role: Allows dynamic extension of Agenticâ€™s capabilities via interchangeable plugins/providers for tasks, integrations, or tools.
Rationale: Supports extensibility and third-party integration without core changes.

### [2025-04-14 14:56:19] - Event-driven Architecture
Role: Enables decoupled communication between components through events (e.g., task completion, user actions).
Rationale: Promotes scalability, observability, and reactive workflows.

### [2025-04-14 14:56:19] - Microkernel (Modular Core + Plugins)
Role: Core system provides essential services; all advanced features are implemented as plugins.
Rationale: Minimizes core complexity, encourages modularity, and allows feature isolation.

### [2025-04-14 14:56:19] - Clean Architecture (Hexagonal/Ports & Adapters)
Role: Enforces separation between business logic and external interfaces (UI, DB, APIs) via explicit ports/adapters.
Rationale: Increases testability, flexibility, and resilience to technology changes.
