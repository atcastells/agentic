- [2025-04-14 14:16:00] - Memory Bank initialized. Initial context files created.
[2025-04-14 14:56:49] - Adopted Layered (N-tier), Plugin/Provider, Event-driven, Microkernel (Modular Core + Plugins), and Clean Architecture (Hexagonal/Ports & Adapters) patterns for Agentic backend. Rationale: These patterns collectively maximize modularity, extensibility, and maintainability, and align with the architectural analysis and requirements described in projectBrief.md.
