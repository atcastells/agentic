# Task Log: TASK-TS-20250415-225645 - TypeScript Enhancement

**Goal:** Install and configure tsoa, and convert FlowController to use tsoa decorators for all routes.

---
**Progress:**
- Converted `FlowController.ts` to use tsoa decorators for all routes.
- Cleaned up unused imports to resolve linter errors.
- Attempted to generate tsoa spec/routes, but encountered a type resolution error related to `e.Request` in the `create` method.
- The likely cause is the use of `@TsoaRequest() req?: Request` in the method signature. tsoa expects the type to be `express.Request`, not an alias or imported as `Request`.

**Next step:** Adjust the `create` method to use the correct type for the request parameter and re-run tsoa generation.
