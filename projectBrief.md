# Project Overview
## Project Name: Agentic

This project aims to create a hosted platform for building and executing agentic software systems. Agentic will provide a service where users can define autonomous agent flows through a web interface or configuration files, execute these flows via API, and get results without requiring any local SDK installation.

## Architectural Approach

### Modular Agent Flow Definition
- Agent flows are defined through a web interface or via JSON/YAML configuration files
- Flows are stored in MongoDB with versioning and schema validation
- Users can import/export flow definitions for backup or sharing

### LLM Provider Abstraction
- Platform integrates multiple LLM providers (OpenRouter, LM Studio initially)
- All LLMs implement a common interface for seamless operation
- Users select providers at the platform level or per-flow based on requirements
- New LLM providers can be added to the platform without affecting existing flows

### Service API
RESTful API for flow management and execution:
- `POST /flows` - Create a new flow
- `GET /flows` - List all flows
- `GET /flows/{id}` - Get flow details
- `POST /flows/{id}/execute` - Run a flow with specified inputs
- `GET /executions/{id}` - Get execution results

Additional API features:
- API keys for authentication and rate limiting
- Webhook support for asynchronous notifications

### Web Interface
- Flow builder with visual editor for creating agent flows
- Dashboard for monitoring flow executions
- Analytics on usage, performance, and costs
- User and team management

### Observability
- OpenTelemetry integration for comprehensive monitoring
- Execution logs viewable in the web interface
- Performance metrics and insights available to users
- Optional log streaming to external systems
