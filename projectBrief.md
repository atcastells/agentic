# Project Overview

## Project Name: Agentic

This project aims to create a hosted platform for building and executing agentic software systems. Agentic will provide a service where users can define autonomous agent agents through a web interface or configuration files, execute these agents via API, and get results without requiring any local SDK installation.

## Architectural Approach

### Modular Agent Agent Definition

- Agent agents are defined through a web interface or via JSON/YAML configuration files
- Agents are stored in MongoDB with versioning and schema validation
- Users can import/export agent definitions for backup or sharing

### LLM Provider Abstraction

- Platform integrates multiple LLM providers (OpenRouter, LM Studio initially)
- All LLMs implement a common interface for seamless operation
- Users select providers at the platform level or per-agent based on requirements
- New LLM providers can be added to the platform without affecting existing agents

### Service API

RESTful API for agent management and execution:

- `POST /agents` - Create a new agent
- `GET /agents` - List all agents
- `GET /agents/{id}` - Get agent details
- `POST /agents/{id}/execute` - Run a agent with specified inputs
- `GET /executions/{id}` - Get execution results

Additional API features:

- API keys for authentication and rate limiting
- Webhook support for asynchronous notifications

### Web Interface

- Agent builder with visual editor for creating agent agents
- Dashboard for monitoring agent executions
- Analytics on usage, performance, and costs
- User and team management

### Observability

- OpenTelemetry integration for comprehensive monitoring
- Execution logs viewable in the web interface
- Performance metrics and insights available to users
- Optional log streaming to external systems
